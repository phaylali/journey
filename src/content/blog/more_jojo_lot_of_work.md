I couldn't wake up early as I was planning, instead woke up late at 11AM with a headache, been a lot of work but I did speed up the workflow quite a bit.
came home and watched jojo S05E18 to S05E25.
for the website I removed the icons in the header and added and fixed social icons in the footer, also cleaned the front page from the default text to prepare it for something cool.
added a place for projects where I'm gonna link every project (software and such) that I consider worthy of showing the world.
